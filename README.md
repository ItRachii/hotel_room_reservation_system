# hotel_room_reservation_system
This project implements a room reservation system for a hotel that optimally assigns rooms to guests based on a travel time minimization strategy. The system takes into account both horizontal (room-to-room) and vertical (floor-to-floor) travel times to ensure guests receive rooms that are as convenient as possible.
